Currently many organizations use many, if not countless, online services, tools, web apps etc to bring productivity to their employees daily work. For employees, if it brings productivity on one hand then on the other hand they need to manage all these tools so that they can access them conveniently.

The current solution many employees use is the browsers default bookmarks. However, toolbox, bring all these tools at one place. All employees have to do is login to toolbox, where list of all the online services and tools can be viewed they need rather than going through inconvenient browser's default bookmark features they offer.

## About Toolbox

Currently many organizations use many, if not countless, online services, tools, web apps etc to bring productivity to their employees daily work. For employees if it brings productivity on one hand then on the other hand they need to manage all these tools so that they can access them conveniently.

The current solution many employees use is the browsers' default bookmarks. However, the Toolbox bring all these tools at one place so all employees have to do is to login to toolbox and they see all the online services they need rather than going through inconvenient browser default bookmark features they offer.
